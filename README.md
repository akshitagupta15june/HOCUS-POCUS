### Have you ever thought of making visible things invisible, just like Harry Potter did with that invisible cloak? ðŸ§™ ðŸ§™ ðŸ§™

The cloak was magical and invisible in Harry Potter, the movie. As we know there is no magic and no invisible cloak which exists in
the world. Itâ€™s all about the graphics tricks.

The concept of an invisibility cloak is a mixture of science, fantasy, and the collective imagination.

### This magic project will help you to create your own â€˜Invisibility Cloakâ€™.

Here is my friend [Anamika Pal](https://github.com/anamika-pal)

It will make use of Python and OpenCV modules specifically targeting Image Processing and Image Segmentation to create a false sense of invisibility in the frame.


### How to create your own â€˜Invisibility Cloakâ€™???


 1) To achieve this, initially, weâ€™ll be capturing and storing the backdrop frame.

 2) Thereafter weâ€™ll be identifying the red (You can use any coloured cloak but for that just change the range of â€˜H.S.Vâ€™ value according to the particular [colour table](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwilhdnmibjwAhXkwTgGHb7CD0cQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapidtables.com%2Fconvert%2Fcolor%2Frgb-to-hsv.html&usg=AOvVaw1jGli7ypPaRMx6x65JVbVe)) colored fabric by making use of the above-mentioned algorithms.

3) Then weâ€™ll segment out the red-colored fabric by generating a mask and then finally.

4) We will generate the final augmented(magical) output to create an Invisibility cloak.

This technique is opposite to the Green Screening.
But unlike green screening where we remove the background, in this application, we remove the foreground!
