# HOCUS-POCUS

### Have you ever thought of making visible things invisible, just like Harry Potter did with that invisible cloak?

The cloak was magical and invisible in Harry Potter, the movie. As we know there is no magic and no invisible cloak which exists in
the world. It’s all about the graphics tricks.

The concept of an invisibility cloak is a mixture of science, fantasy, and the collective imagination.

### This magic project will help you to create your own ‘Invisibility Cloak’.

Here is my friend [Anamika Pal](https://github.com/anamika-pal)

It will make use of Python and OpenCV modules specifically targeting Image Processing and Image Segmentation to create a false sense of invisibility in the frame.


### How to create your own ‘Invisibility Cloak’??

1) To achieve this, initially we’ll be capturing and storing the backdrop frame.

2) Thereafter we’ll be identifying the red (You can use any coloured cloak but for that just change the BGR value according to the particular [colour table](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiq47ywh7jwAhU4zTgGHcWZAzQQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapidtables.com%2Fweb%2Fcolor%2FRGB_Color.html&usg=AOvVaw2ZA61-UF3KhLTWCdjG1Piz)) coloured fabric by making use of the above mentioned algorithms. 

3) Then we’ll segment out the red colored fabric by generating a mask and then finally.

4)  We will generate the final augmented(magical) output to create Invisibility cloak.
